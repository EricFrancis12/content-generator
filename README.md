# Content Generator


## A fully functional Content Creation Engine written in Typescript utilizing Docker and Docker Compose that allows you to create fully-automated Content Creation Campaigns that run on autopilot!

With this tool, you will be able to:

- Create automated YouTube Channels, Instagram Accounts, Twitter Accounts, etc.
- Create bots for Discord, Telegram, etc.
- Whenever a source publishes something new, use that piece of content to trigger a flow
- Set up your own publishing system that programatically transforms existing content into something completely original
- Use your imagination to create your own use cases and share them with us!

Features (Work In Progress):

- Set up and run your own Content Creation Campaigns
- Use Campaign Filters to do video/image overlays, merges, concatenations, and more
- Publish to multiple platforms at once
- Easy-to-use User Interface (no programming knowledge required to use)
